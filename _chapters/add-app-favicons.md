Create React App generates a simple favicon for our app and places it in `public/favicon.ico`. However, getting the favicon to work on all browsers and mobile platforms requires a little more work. There are quite a few different requirements and dimensions. And this gives us a good opportunity to learn how to include files in the `public/` directory of our app.

For our example, we are going to start with a simple image and generate the various versions from it.

**Right-click to download** the following image.

<img alt="App Icon" width="130" height="130" src="/assets/scratch-icon.png" />

To ensure that our icon works for most of our targeted platforms we'll use a service called the [Favicon Generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net).

Click **Select your Favicon picture** to upload our icon.

Once you upload your icon, it'll show you a preview of your icon on various platforms. Scroll down the page and hit the **Generate your Favicons and HTML code** button.

This should generate your favicon package and the accompanying code.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Click **Favicon package** to download the generated favicons. And copy all the files over to your `public/` directory.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Then replace the contents of `public/manifest.json` with the following:

``` json
{
  "short_name": "Scratch",
  "name": "Scratch Note Taking App",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "android-chrome-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "android-chrome-256x256.png",
      "sizes": "256x256",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": "./index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#ffffff",
  "background_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

To include a file from the `public/` directory in your HTML, Create React App needs the `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Add this to your `public/index.html`.

``` html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon-32x32.png" sizes="32x32">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon-16x16.png" sizes="16x16">
<link rel="mask-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/safari-pinned-tab.svg" color="#5bbad5">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />And **remove** the following lines that reference the original favicon and theme color.

``` html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000">
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
```

Finally head over to your browser and try the `/favicon-32x32.png` path to ensure that the files were added correctly.

Next we are going to look into setting up custom fonts in our app.
