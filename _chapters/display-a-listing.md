title: Display a Note
date: 2018-01-28 00:00:00
description: We want to create a page in our React.js app that will display a user’s note based on the id in the URL. We are going to use the React Router v4 Route component’s URL parameters to get the id. Using this id we are going to request our note from the serverless backend API. And use AWS Amplify's Storage.vault.get() method to get a secure link to download our attachment.
context: frontend
comments_id: 53

Now that we have a listing of all the notes, let's create a page that displays a note and let's the user edit it.

The first thing we are going to need to do is load the note when our container loads. Just like what we did in the `Home` container. So let's get started.

### Add the Route

Let's add a route for the note page that we are going to create.

<img class="code-marker" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/s.png" />Add the following line to `src/Routes.js` below our `/notes/new` route. We are using the `AppliedRoute` component that we created in the [Add the session to the state]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _chapters/add-the-session-to-the-state.md %}) chapter.

``` coffee
<AppliedRoute path="/notes/:id" exact component={Notes} props={childProps} />
```

This is important because we are going to be pattern matching to extract our note id from the URL.

By using the route path `/notes/:id` we are telling the router to send all matching routes to our component `Notes`. This will also end up matching the route `/notes/new` with an `id` of `new`. To ensure that doesn't happen, we put our `/notes/new` route before the pattern matching one.

<img class="code-marker" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/s.png" />And include our component in the header.

``` javascript
import Notes from "./containers/Notes";
```

Of course this component doesn't exist yet and we are going to create it now.

### Add the Container

<img class="code-marker" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/s.png" />Create a new file `src/containers/Notes.js` and add the following.

``` coffee
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { API, Storage } from "aws-amplify";

export default class Notes extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.file = null;

    this.state = {
      note: null,
      content: "",
      attachmentURL: null
    };
  }

  async componentDidMount() {
    try {
      let attachmentURL;
      const note = await this.getNote();
      const { content, attachment } = note;

      if (attachment) {
        attachmentURL = await Storage.vault.get(attachment);
      }

      this.setState({
        note,
        content,
        attachmentURL
      });
    } catch (e) {
      alert(e);
    }
  }

  getNote() {
    return API.get("notes", `/notes/${this.props.match.params.id}`);
  }

  render() {
    return <div className="Notes"></div>;
  }
}
```

We are doing a couple of things here.

1. Load the note on `componentDidMount` and save it to the state. We get the `id` of our note from the URL using the props automatically passed to us by React-Router in `this.props.match.params.id`. The keyword `id` is a part of the pattern matching in our route (`/notes/:id`).

2. If there is an attachment, we use the key to get a secure link to the file we uploaded to S3. We then store this to the component's state as `attachmentURL`.

3. The reason why we have the `note` object in the state along with the `content` and the `attachmentURL` is because we will be using this later when the user edits the note.

Now if you switch over to your browser and navigate to a note that we previously created, you'll notice that the page renders an empty container.

Next up, we are going to render the note we just loaded.
