Let's create a page where the users of our app can login with their credentials. When we created our User Pool we asked it to allow a user to sign in and sign up with their email as their username. We'll be touching on this further when we create the signup form.

So let's start by creating the basic form that'll take the user's email (as their username) and password.

### Add the Container

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Create a new file `src/containers/Login.js` and add the following.

``` coffee
import React, { Component } from "react";
import { Button, FormGroup, FormControl, ControlLabel } from "react-bootstrap";
import "./Login.css";

export default class Login extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = {
      email: "",
      password: ""
    };
  }

  validateForm() {
    return this.state.email.length > 0 && this.state.password.length > 0;
  }

  handleChange = event => {
    this.setState({
      [event.target.id]: event.target.value
    });
  }

  handleSubmit = event => {
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="Login">
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <FormGroup controlId="email" bsSize="large">
            <ControlLabel>Email</ControlLabel>
            <FormControl
              autoFocus
              type="email"
              value={this.state.email}
              onChange={this.handleChange}
            />
          </FormGroup>
          <FormGroup controlId="password" bsSize="large">
            <ControlLabel>Password</ControlLabel>
            <FormControl
              value={this.state.password}
              onChange={this.handleChange}
              type="password"
            />
          </FormGroup>
          <Button
            block
            bsSize="large"
            disabled={!this.validateForm()}
            type="submit"
          >
            Login
          </Button>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

We are introducing a couple of new concepts in this.

1. In the constructor of our component we create a state object. This will be where we'll store what the user enters in the form.

2. We then connect the state to our two fields in the form by setting `this.state.email` and `this.state.password` as the `value` in our input fields. This means that when the state changes, React will re-render these components with the updated value.

3. But to update the state when the user types something into these fields, we'll call a handle function named `handleChange`. This function grabs the `id` (set as `controlId` for the `<FormGroup>`) of the field being changed and updates its state with the value the user is typing in. Also, to have access to the `this` keyword inside `handleChange` we store the reference to an anonymous function like so: `handleChange = (event) => { } `.

4. We are setting the `autoFocus` flag for our email field, so that when our form loads, it sets focus to this field.

5. We also link up our submit button with our state by using a validate function called `validateForm`. This simply checks if our fields are non-empty, but can easily do something more complicated.

6. Finally, we trigger our callback `handleSubmit` when the form is submitted. For now we are simply suppressing the browsers default behavior on submit but we'll do more here later.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Let's add a couple of styles to this in the file `src/containers/Login.css`.

``` css
@media all and (min-width: 480px) {
  .Login {
    padding: 60px 0;
  }

  .Login form {
    margin: 0 auto;
    max-width: 320px;
  }
}
```

These styles roughly target any non-mobile screen sizes.

### Add the Route

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Now we link this container up with the rest of our app by adding the following line to `src/Routes.js` below our home `<Route>`.

``` coffee
<Route path="/login" exact component={Login} />
```

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />And include our component in the header.

``` javascript
import Login from "./containers/Login";
```

Now if we switch to our browser and navigate to the login page we should see our newly created form.

Next, let's connect our login form to our AWS Cognito set up.
